### Description
> Given two binary trees, write a function to check if they are equal or not.

> Two binary trees are considered equal if they are structurally identical and the nodes have the same value.

### Solution
[Same Tree](http://oj.leetcode.com/problems/same-tree/) is very easy if we consider in a recursive way. Tree A and Tree B can be considered as the same if the value of root of A and the value of root of B are the same, and left sub-tree of A is the same as left sub-tree of B, and the same for right sub-tree of A and B.

So the pseudo code of this algorithm:

{% highlight c++ %}
bool isSameTree(p, q) {
    if (p is NULL and q is NULL) {
        return same;
    }
    else {
        if (p or q is NULL) {
            return different;
        }
        else {
            if (value of p and q are different) {
                return different;
            }
            else {
                return isSameTree(p->left, q->left) and isSameTree(p->right, q->right);
            }
        }
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}


### Summary
We can test recursively. Two trees are the same if values of roots are the same and left and right sub-trees are the same respectively.
